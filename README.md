# Contact List

#### By James Osborn

## :large_blue_diamond: Description

Contact List is a simple C# website that allows the user to add a contact to a list. Information contained within the contact includes 'Name,' 'Phone,' and 'Address.'

Once the user adds a contact to the list, they will be given the option to add another contact, or to view their entire Contact List. Adding another contact will give the user the form for adding a contact again, while clicking on the Contact List will give a list of Contact names. Clicking on any of those Contact names will bring the user to a new page with all of that contact's specific information.
